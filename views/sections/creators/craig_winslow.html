                    <p>Born and raised a New Englander, from just outside of Portland, Maine, Winslow’s creative pursuits utilize multiple mediums, from projection mapping, 3D, AR, VR, to XR; focused on the 'never done before’ by using a mix of new, old, and emerging technologies, always with a playful passion to his approach.</p>
                    <p>After studying graphic design and 3D art, he worked in digital production and then industrial design at JDK Design. Winslow left to work independently and has spent the past several years building his own studio and creating conceptual and interactive work for clients. As Adobe Creative Resident (2016-2017) he brought to life Light Capsules, an ongoing project reviving faded hand-painted ads across the world. His first permanent exhibition 'Brilliant!' launched in Las Vegas in 2018 at The Neon Museum, which his studio continues to lead all technical and content creation. In Summer 2019 he worked with Tim Burton on his exhibition 'Lost Vegas' at The Neon Museum.</p>
                    <p>Some other past clients include NikeLab, Portland Trail Blazers, Tim Burton, Coca-Cola Consolidated, The Neon Museum, Adobe, Princeton University, Bucketfeet, Burton Snowboards, Xbox, Seventh Generation, Beats by Dr. Dre, Incase, and Virgin Mobile.</p>
