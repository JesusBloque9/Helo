                    <p>From his presence in the avant-synth music scene in the 1970s and the early hip-hop scene of the 1980s, KK Barrett broke onto the design scene with such iconic music videos as Beck's "New Pollution" and Smashing Pumpkins' "Tonight, Tonight", both of which earned him the MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction. From there, he partnered with Spike Jonze to bring moviegoers into the fascinating world of Being John Malkovich 1999. He's since served as production designer on films such as Adaptation, Lost in Translation, I Heart Huckabees, and Where the Wild Things Are. Barrett was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Production Design for his futurist look at our life with technology in Jonze's film, HER. His extensive design experience in the commercial space includes designing spots for brands such as Nissan, GE, Levi's, Budweiser, Xfinity, Audi and others. In the experiential and directing realm, he’s created a genre-mashing adaptation of Kid Koala's graphic novel, “Nufonia Must Fall”, the live theatrical event “Stop the Virgens”, (an opera he co-created with Karen O), and numerous commercial projects for brands including Levi's and Disney Theme Parks.</p>
